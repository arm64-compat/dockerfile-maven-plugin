# ARM64 compatible dockerfile-maven-plugin

ARM64 build for dockerfile-maven-plugin

[![Maven Package](https://github.com/arm64-compat/dockerfile-maven-plugin/actions/workflows/maven-publish.yaml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/arm64-compat/dockerfile-maven-plugin/actions/workflows/maven-publish.yaml)

Current version of dockerfile-maven-plugin doesn't support building `arm64` docker images.

With the growing popularity of Mac M1 processor in at Workspaces, it breaks the build process and creates a lot of troubles for everyone in the team. Hence this project is trying to provide a solution for arm compatible builds.

**Note**: these packages are not going to be maintained on regular-basis, but we will be willing to accept contributions. They are also not tested very well so don't build for production systems.

Thanks for suggestion at https://github.com/spotify/dockerfile-maven/issues/367#issuecomment-1062624063 which helped me figure out how to build and provide the plugin for arm compatibility.

## How to Use

If you want to use the docker-client supporting `arm64` use `docker-client` package.

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.spotify</groupId>
    <artifactId>docker-client</artifactId>
    <version>8.16.1-SNAPSHOT</version>
</dependency>
```

If you just want to use the plugin, use the following:

```xml
<build>
    <plugins>
        <plugin>
            <groupId>com.spotify</groupId>
            <artifactId>dockerfile-maven-plugin</artifactId>
            <version>1.4.14-SNAPSHOT</version>
        </plugin>
    </plugins>
</build>
```

## How do I fetch these images

This will be a little tricky to setup. Suggestions are welcome for a better approach.

Add github to your repository:

```xml
<repositories>
    <repository>
        <id>github</id>
        <url>https://maven.pkg.github.com/arm64-compat/dockerfile-maven-plugin</url>
        <snapshots>
            <enabled>true</enabled>
        </snapshots>
        <releases>
            <enabled>false</enabled>
        </releases>
    </repository>
    <pluginRepository>
        <id>github</id>
        <url>https://maven.pkg.github.com/arm64-compat/dockerfile-maven-plugin</url>
        <snapshots>
            <enabled>true</enabled>
        </snapshots>
        <releases>
            <enabled>false</enabled>
        </releases>
    </pluginRepository>
</repositories>
```

You may also use custom user `settings.xml` file to configure these repositories to include in your build system.

These packages are published on `github` and to download even a public package from github, it requires [Personal Access Token](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token).

Thus you would need something like following in your settings.xml file:

```xml
<servers>
    <server>
        <id>github</id>
        <username>${GITHUB_USERNAME}</username>
        <password>${GITHUB_TOKEN}</password>
    </server>
</servers>  
```

You can then provide `$GITHUB_USERNAME` and `$GITHUB_TOKEN` using environment variables.

## Using package manager

The above can be a little tricky for maven newcomers to setup.

However much simpler approach would be if you are using your own package manager (like `nexus`) is to proxy this package to your package manager and then use from there directly like you do for your other dependencies.

Howevery the `-SNAPSHOT` version can remain, because the real-owner of the package is `spotify`. This is just provided for streamlining local builds.

Setting build profiles for `Arm64` based architectures would really help all the developers in the team to build without much hassel.
